## Project Description

This project is a Python implementation of the classic Snake game using the Pygame library. The game runs in a grid environment with the snake controlled by arrow keys. It features a visually improved snake with rounded body segments and eyes on the head. The player collects apples to grow longer while avoiding collisions with walls or its own body.

## How to Play

- Use arrow keys to move the snake up, down, left, or right  
- Press 'P' to pause the game (snake stops moving)  
- Eat red apples to grow and increase score  
- Avoid hitting the walls or the snake’s own body  
- The game resets on collision, but your highest score will be saved

## High Score Saving

The game automatically saves your highest score in a file called `highscore.txt`. When you start the game again, this high score is loaded and displayed on-screen alongside your current score. The highest score achieved is updated and saved whenever you beat it.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3  
- Pygame library for game window and graphics  

---

## Future Improvements

- Add sound effects for eating apples and collisions  
- Include smooth movement animation for the snake  
- Add multiple difficulty levels or speed settings  
- Design more sophisticated graphics or textures for the snake  
- Implement a main menu and pause menu
